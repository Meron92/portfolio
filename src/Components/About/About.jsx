          <p>
            After many years as a warehouse employee, I made the decision to
            finally apply to the program I had been eyeing for a long time,
            frontend developer at NBI/Handelsakademin, and am now in my second
            and final academic year.
            <br />
            <br />
            The first academic year has been extremely educational and with each
            passing day, I became even more certain that I have made the right
            decision and that it is within this industry that I want to continue
            to develop within.
            <br />
            <br />I have the drive and desire within me to constantly continue
            to develop. The qualities I bring to you are innovative thinking,
            drive, problem solver, and the desire to learn.
